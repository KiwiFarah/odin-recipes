        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>How long does it take to cook a turkey? It's one of the most frequently asked Thanksgiving cooking questions we get at Allrecipes, so let's get right to the answer!</p>
        <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Turkey is done at an internal temperature of 165 degrees F</li>
            <li>Allow the turkey to rest for at least 30 minutes before carving and serving
            </li>
            <li>Using an oven thermometer ($7; Target) and a meat thermometer to get accurate temperature readings is recommended</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the packet of giblets from the cavity of the bird and save them for gravy or stuffing. Next, use paper towels to pat dry the bird inside and out.
            </li>
            <li>Tie drumsticks together with string, and brush the skin with melted butter or oil. See how to truss a turkey.</li>
            <li>Place the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan, and into a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven and follow the cooking times above based on the weight of your bird.</li>
            <li>Roast until the skin is a light golden color, then cover the breast loosely with a foil tent to prevent further browning. During the last 45 minutes of roasting, remove the foil tent to brown the skin. Basting is not necessary, but does help promote even browning.
            </li>
            <li>When the turkey is done, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, and makes for easier carving.
